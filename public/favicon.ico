The contents of the file /my-nextjs-app/my-nextjs-app/public/favicon.ico should be the binary data for the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary data directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file and place it in the specified directory.

This file is intentionally left blank.
